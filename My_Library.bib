	abstract = {Textbooks are a standard component of undergraduate mathematics courses, but research shows that students often do not view textbooks as productive resources to support learning. This article seeks to understand the factors affecting how individuals engage in reading a calculus textbook excerpt and what they learn from reading. To better understand the separate roles of background knowledge and other reading practices, we compare 2 readers: a 2nd-semester calculus student and a nonmathematics {STEM} professor. We employ the concepts of
              sense making
              and the
              implied reader
              to analyze each reader’s experience and a disciplinary literacy perspective to explain the similarities and differences we find between the 2 readers. We propose the concept of
              didactical disciplinary literacy
              —an adaptation of disciplinary literacy applied to didactical texts—to describe the ways that the professor drew on his identity as a teacher to shape his reading practices.},

	abstract = {Background As the maker movement is increasingly adopted into K-12 schools, students are developing new competences in exploration and fabrication technologies. This study assesses learning with these technologies in K-12 makerspaces and {FabLabs}.
Purpose Our study describes the iterative process of developing an assessment instrument for this new technological literacy, the Exploration and Fabrication Technologies Instrument, and presents ﬁndings from implementations at ﬁve schools in three countries. Our index is generalizable and psychometrically sound, and permits comparison between student conﬁdence and performance. Design/Method Our evaluation of distinct technology skills separates general computing, information and communication technology ({ICT}), and exploration and fabrication technologies ({EFTs}) into nonoverlapping areas of technological expertise required to perform their respective sets of tasks. The instrument also tracks student conﬁdence in {EFT} skills and assesses how that conﬁdence relates to actual task performance.
Results Exploration and fabrication technologies constitute a new and distinct set of technology literacies arising from fabrication settings. The {EFT} instrument compares students’ selfreported conﬁdence with their performance on complex design tasks and demonstrates that, for students, exposure to general computing and {ICT} tools differs from exposure to {EFT} tools.
Conclusion The {EFT} instrument captures a new and distinct set of technology literacies that arise within fabrication settings and are independent of both general computing and digital content production skills.},

	title = {Critical Theory},
	url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2016/entries/critical-theory/},
	abstract = {Critical Theory has a narrow and a broad meaning in philosophy and inthe history of the social sciences. “Critical Theory” inthe narrow sense designates several generations of German philosophersand social theorists in the Western European Marxist tradition knownas the Frankfurt School. According to these theorists, a“critical” theory may be distinguished from a“traditional” theory according to a specific practicalpurpose: a theory is critical to the extent that it seeks human“emancipation from slavery”, acts as a “liberating… influence”, and works “to create a world whichsatisfies the needs and powers” of human beings (Horkheimer1972, 246).  Because such theories aim to explain andtransform all the circumstances that enslave human beings,many “critical theories” in the broader sense have beendeveloped. They have emerged in connection with the many socialmovements that identify varied dimensions of the domination of humanbeings in modern societies. In both the broad and the narrow senses,however, a critical theory provides the descriptive and normativebases for social inquiry aimed at decreasing domination and increasingfreedom in all their forms., Critical Theory in the narrow sense has had many different aspects andquite distinct historical phases that cross several generations, fromthe effective start of the Institute for Social Research in the years1929–1930, which saw the arrival of the Frankfurt Schoolphilosophers and an inaugural lecture by Horkheimer, to thepresent. Its distinctiveness as a philosophical approach that extendsto ethics, political philosophy, and the philosophy of history is mostapparent when considered in light of the history of the philosophy ofthe social sciences. Critical Theorists have long sought todistinguish their aims, methods, theories, and forms of explanationfrom standard understandings in both the natural and the socialsciences. Instead, they have claimed that social inquiry ought tocombine rather than separate the poles of philosophy and the socialsciences: explanation and understanding, structure and agency,regularity and normativity.  Such an approach, Critical Theoristsargue, permits their enterprise to be practical in adistinctively moral (rather than instrumental) sense. They do notmerely seek to provide the means to achieve some independent goal, butrather (as in Horkheimer's famous definition mentioned above) seek“human emancipation” in circumstances of domination andoppression. This normative task cannot be accomplished apart from theinterplay between philosophy and social science throughinterdisciplinary empirical social research (Horkheimer 1993). {WhileCritical} Theory is often thought of narrowly as referring to {theFrankfurt} School that begins with Horkheimer and Adorno and stretchesto Marcuse and Habermas, any philosophical approach with similarpractical aims could be called a “critical theory,”including feminism, critical race theory, and some forms ofpost-colonial criticism. In the following, Critical Theory whencapitalized refers only to the Frankfurt School. All other uses of theterm are meant in the broader sense and thus not capitalized. Whenused in the singular, “a critical theory” is notcapitalized, even when the theory is developed by members of {theFrankfurt} School in the context of their overall project of {CriticalTheory}., It follows from Horkheimer's definition that a critical theory isadequate only if it meets three criteria: it must be explanatory,practical, and normative, all at the same time. That is, it mustexplain what is wrong with current social reality, identify the actorsto change it, and provide both clear norms for criticism andachievable practical goals for social transformation. Any trulycritical theory of society, as Horkheimer further defined it in hiswritings as Director of the Frankfurt School's Institute for {SocialResearch}, “has as its object human beings as producers of theirown historical form of life” (Horkeimer 1993, 21). In light ofthe practical goal of identifying and overcoming all the circumstancesthat limit human freedom, the explanatory goal could be furthered onlythrough interdisciplinary research that includes psychological,cultural, and social dimensions, as well as institutional forms ofdomination. Given the emphasis among the first generation of {CriticalTheory} on human beings as the self-creating producers of their ownhistory, a unique practical aim of social inquiry suggests itself: totransform contemporary capitalism into a consensual form of sociallife. For Horkheimer a capitalist society could be transformed only bybecoming more democratic, to make it such that “all conditionsof social life that are controllable by human beings depend on realconsensus” in a rational society (Horkheimer 1972, 249–250). Thenormative orientation of Critical Theory, at least in its form ofcritical social inquiry, is therefore towards the transformation ofcapitalism into a “real democracy” in which such controlcould be exercised (Horkheimer 1972, 250). In such formulations, thereare striking similarities between Critical Theory and Americanpragmatism., The focus on democracy as the location for cooperative, practical andtransformative activity continues today in the work of {JürgenHabermas}, as does the attempt to determine the nature and limits of“real democracy” in complex, pluralistic, and globalizingsocieties., As might be expected from such an ambitious philosophical project andform of inquiry, Critical Theory is rife with tensions. In whatfollows I will develop the arguments within Critical Theory thatsurround its overall philosophical project. First, I explore its basicphilosophical orientation or metaphilosophy. In its efforts to combineempirical social inquiry and normative philosophical argumentation,Critical Theory presents a viable alternative for social and politicalphilosophy today. Second, I will consider its core normativetheory—its relation to its transformation of a Kantian ethics ofautonomy into a conception of freedom and justice in which democracyand democratic ideals play a central role (Horkheimer 1993, 22;Horkheimer 1972, 203). As a member of the second generation {ofCritical} Theory, Habermas in particular has developed this dimensionof normative political theory into a competitor to Rawlsianconstructivism, which attempts to bring our pretheoretical intuitionsinto reflective equilibrium. In the third section, I will consider itsempirical orientation in practical social theory and practical socialinquiry that aims at promoting democratic norms. A fundamental tensionemerges between a comprehensive social theory that provides atheoretical basis for social criticism and a more pluralist andpractical orientation that does not see any particular theory ormethodology as distinctive of Critical Theory as such. In this way,the unresolved tension between the empirical and normative aspects ofthe project of a critical theory oriented to the realization of humanfreedom is manifest in each of its main contributions to philosophyinformed by social science. Finally, I examine the contribution {ofCritical} Theory to debates about globalization, in which the potentialtransformation of both democratic ideals and institutions is atstake.},

In prac tice, the term "prevention" seems to be applied confusingly to a wide array of contradictory activities. This confusion can be avoided through the use of a conceptual model that defines three levels of prevention: (1) primary prevention, directed at modification of criminogenic conditions in the physical and social environment at large; (2) secondary prevention, directed at early identification and intervention in the lives of individuals or groups in criminogenic circumstances; and (3) tertiary prevention, directed at prevention of recidivism. The use of such a conceptual model helps to clarify current crime prevention efforts, suggests fruitful directions for future research by identifying current lacunae in practice and in the research literature, and may ultimately prove helpful in ad dressing the seemingly endless debate between advocates of "punishment " and advocates of "treatment."},

Using time-series data collected as part of a series of classroom observations, we demonstrate that not only are clear differences manifest in terms of what occurred within each space, but that the different classroom types are linked causally to the observed differences in instructor and student behavior.},

This article argues that this assumption inevitably limits the effectiveness of such practices. Drawing on recent research into cognition as it is manifest in everyday activity, the authors argue that knowledge is situated, being in part a product of the activity, context, and culture in which it is developed and used. They discuss how this view of knowledge affects our understanding of learning, and they note that conventional schooling too often ignores the influence of school culture on what is learned in school. As an alternative to conventional practices, they propose "cognitive apprenticeship" (Collins, Brown, \& Newman, in press), which honors the situated nature of knowledge. They examine two examples of mathematics instruction that exhibit certain key features of this approach to teaching.]},

We derive various arithmetic bounds on elementary relations in {NPol}(d), called quantum jumps. The existence of extremal objects in {NPol}(d) is a challenge of number theoretical ﬂavor, leading to interesting classes of normal polytopes: minimal, maximal, spherical. Minimal elements in {NPol}(5) have played a critical role in disproving various covering conjectures for normal polytopes in the 1990s. Here we report on the ﬁrst examples of maximal elements in {NPol}(4) and {NPol}(5), found by a combination of the developed theory, random generation, and extensive computer search.},

The results showed that the {AR} group performed better than the non-{AR} group, and high-anxiety learners in the {AR} group outperformed in algebra and geometry. The {AR} group had higher motivation based on Keller’s {ARCS} model. The highanxiety learners had higher confidence and satisfaction and lower anxiety when learning using mobile {AR}. The {AR} users were satisfied with ease of use, usefulness, playfulness, and benefit from exploration and hands-on experiences. Moreover, highanxiety users in the {AR} group had higher perceptions of exploration, hands-on experiences, and playfulness.

	abstract = {Mathematicians and mathematics educators agree that proof is an important tool in mathematics, yet too often undergraduate students see proof as a superﬁcial part of the discipline. While proof is often used by mathematicians to justify that a theorem is true, many times proof is used for another purpose entirely such as to explain why a particular statement is true or to show mathematics students a particular proof technique. This paper reports on a study that used a form of inquiry-based learning ({IBL}) in an introduction to proof course and measured the beliefs of students in this course about the diﬀerent functions of proof in mathematics as compared to students in a non-{IBL} course. It was found that undergraduate students in an introduction to proof course had a more robust understanding of the functions of proof than previous studies would suggest. Additionally, students in the course taught using inquiry pedagogy were more likely to appreciate the communication, intellectual challenge, and providing autonomy functions of proof. It is hypothesized that these results are a response to the pedagogy of the course and the types of student activity that were emphasized.},

	abstract = {The recent appearance of low cost virtual reality ({VR}) technologies – like the Oculus Rift, the {HTC} Vive and the Sony {PlayStation} {VR} – and Mixed Reality Interfaces ({MRITF}) –like the Hololens – is attracting the attention of users and researchers suggesting it may be the next largest stepping stone in technological innovation. However, the history of {VR} technology is longer than it may seem: the concept of {VR} was formulated in the 1960s and the ﬁrst commercial {VR} tools appeared in the late 1980s. For this reason, during the last 20 years, 100s of researchers explored the processes, effects, and applications of this technology producing 1000s of scientiﬁc papers. What is the outcome of this signiﬁcant research work? This paper wants to provide an answer to this question by exploring, using advanced scientometric techniques, the existing research corpus in the ﬁeld. We collected all the existent articles about {VR} in the Web of Science Core Collection scientiﬁc database, and the resultant dataset contained 21,667 records for {VR} and 9,944 for augmented reality ({AR}). The bibliographic record contained various ﬁelds, such as author, title, abstract, country, and all the references (needed for the citation analysis). The network and cluster analysis of the literature showed a composite panorama characterized by changes and evolutions over the time. Indeed, whether until 5 years ago, the main publication media on {VR} concerned both conference proceeding and journals, more recently journals constitute the main medium of communication. Similarly, if at ﬁrst computer science was the leading research ﬁeld, nowadays clinical areas have increased, as well as the number of countries involved in {VR} research. The present work discusses the evolution and changes over the time of the use of {VR} in the main areas of application with an emphasis on the future expected {VR}’s capacities, increases and challenges. We conclude considering the disruptive contribution that {VR}/{AR}/{MRITF} will be able to get in scientiﬁc ﬁelds, as well in human communication and interaction, as already happened with the advent of mobile phones by increasing the use and the development of scientiﬁc applications (e.g., in clinical areas) and by modifying the social communication and interaction among people.},

Rather, they are constructed as policymakers and constituents interpret a particular aspect of the social world as problematic. How a policy problem is framed is important because it assigns responsibility and creates rationales that authorize some policy solutions and not others. This article brings together sense-making theory and frame analysis to understand the dynamics of problem framing during policy implementation. Data were derived from a yearlong ethnographic study of one school’s response to the California Reading Initiative. Results showed that the school’s response depended on how school staff constructed their understanding of the relevant problem to be solved. The problem framing process was iterative and contested, shaped by authority relations and mediated by teachers’ social networks. Ultimately, it proved important for motivating and coordinating action, reshaping authority relations, and inﬂuencing teachers’ beliefs and practices.},

Using {ACT} scores as predictive, we found that students in the active learning classroom outperformed expectations, whereas those in the traditional classroom did not. By replicating initial work, our results provide empirical confirmation that new, technology-enhanced learning environments positively and independently affect student learning. Our data suggest that creating space for active learning can improve student performance in science courses. However, we recognize that such a commitment of resources is impractical for many institutions, and we offer recommendations for applying what we have learned to more traditional spaces.

This review finds support for common complaints of this research area as lacking in definitions of the concept of identity and suggests that the writing in this topic is at times theoretically incompatible. Furthermore, the work in this field may be coming from two distinct paradigms. Identity may be seen as an action and fit within a sociological frame or it may be seen as an acquisition, fitting within a psychological framing. Defining identity as something we do, as an action, and in particular as performative is promoted in this paper. Finally, suggestions are made for future directions in identity research.},

In this article, we explore three theoretical perspectives that inform the development of such instructional materials. In our team’s efforts to develop a game-based learning applet for an existing inquiry-oriented curriculum, we have sought to theoretically frame our approach so that we can draw on the corpus of researcher knowledge from multiple disciplines. Accordingly, we will discuss three bodies of literature – realistic mathematics education’s [{RME}’s] approach to curriculum development, inquiry-oriented instruction and inquiry-based learning [{IO}/{IBL}], and game-based learning [{GBL}] - and draw on parallels across the three in order to form a coherent approach to developing digital games that draw on expertise in each field.},

	abstract = {Virtual reality represents an emerging technology, which can be successfully used to develop training tools in many domains, such as military, space, education or healthcare. The current paper proposes a training strategy for a sensory substitution device in order to improve the ability of visually impaired people to be autonomous, thus to increase the quality of their lives. The core of the strategy is a highly interactive virtual training environment, composed of 3D scenes simulating both realistic and imaginary settings. The training is based on gamification principles, as the virtual environment is designed as a highly immersive serious game, with essential elements such as quests, rewards or increasing complexity of tasks which can maintain its users motivated and help them acquire useful day-to-day life skills. Also, a series of mini-games are available in the training environment, as repetitive actions can facilitate the improvement of specific skills. By using appropriate hardware equipment, the virtual training environment can be rendered to the visually impaired users through acoustic and haptic means. The paper presents our proposed training strategy based on virtual reality in the context of numerous challenges of offering efficient training experiences to users with special needs.},

Our studies in university classes converge on minimalism: they reveal the effectiveness o tools that make visible what is invisible but do not analyze, predict or decide for teachers. These studies revealed a third circle of usability. The first circle concerns individual usability ({HCI}). The second circle is about design for teams ({CSCL}/{CSCW}). The third circle raises design choices that impart visibility, reification and minimalism on classroom orchestration. The fact that a {CSCL} environment allows or not students to look at what the next team is doing (e.g. tabletops versus desktops) illustrates the third circle issues that are important for orchestration.},

The Coalition met on June 7, 2013, in the historic Shiloh Baptist Church in Trenton, New Jersey to discuss the future of Black Disability Studies ({BDS}). Since that time, members of the Coalition have written an outline for a {BDS} course, presented at conferences, and developed strategies to incorporate {BDS} into the disciplines of Black Studies and Disability Studies. We have also reflected deeply on what the introduction of {BDS} will mean, both for Black Studies and for disability studies.Our writings in this collection are intended to mark the work of the National Black Disability Coalition thus far, but also to provide a platform from which further work in {BDS} can grow. By underscoring the development and potential of {BDS}, this article articulates the need for {BDS} within mainstream disability studies, and advocates for {BDS} not to be taken as a marginalized special-topic course, but rather to be engaged in every and at the heart of Disability Studies courses and pedagogies. Although we believe that {BDS} should be integrated into every Disability Studies course, we recognize that, like disability itself, it cannot simply be “added and stirred”; rather, the inclusion of {BDS} is a paradigm-shifting change. The pieces included in this collection are enactments of an ongoing conversation--a conversation that we hope the readers of Disability Studies Quarterly will join thoughtfully.The sections comprise statements from the leaders of the National Black Disability Coalition, Jane Dunhamn and Leroy Moore; reflective writings from three instructors and two students of Black Disability Studies; and a copy of the course outline.},

Through focus groups with disabled people, the article explores aspects of disabled people’s corporeal identities, feelings and (embodied) encounters in a range of social settings. The research shows that disabled people’s lives are connected to different ‘valuations’ attributed to corporeal forms, and to systems of signiﬁcation and representation, which underpin them. We conclude by reafﬁrming the need to consider Bourdieu’s ideas in helping in the development of disability theory.},

	abstract = {The substantial gender gap in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ({STEM}) workforce can be traced back to the underrepresentation of women at various milestones in the career pathway. Calculus is a necessary step in this pathway and has been shown to often dissuade people from pursuing {STEM} fields. We examine the characteristics of students who begin college interested in {STEM} and either persist or switch out of the calculus sequence after taking Calculus I, and hence either continue to pursue a {STEM} major or are dissuaded from {STEM} disciplines. The data come from a unique, national survey focused on mainstream college calculus. Our analyses show that, while controlling for academic preparedness, career intentions, and instruction, the odds of a woman being dissuaded from continuing in calculus is 1.5 times greater than that for a man. Furthermore, women report they do not understand the course material well enough to continue significantly more often than men. When comparing women and men with above-average mathematical abilities and preparedness, we find women start and end the term with significantly lower mathematical confidence than men. This suggests a lack of mathematical confidence, rather than a lack of mathematically ability, may be responsible for the high departure rate of women. While it would be ideal to increase interest and participation of women in {STEM} at all stages of their careers, our findings indicate that if women persisted in {STEM} at the same rate as men starting in Calculus I, the number of women entering the {STEM} workforce would increase by 75\%.},

Our goal is to produce a “comic book” summary, in which a transcript is augmented with keyframes that disambiguate and clarify accompanying text. Unlike most previous keyframe extraction systems which rely primarily on visual cues, we present a linguistically-motivated approach that selects keyframes that contain salient gestures. Rather than learning gesture salience directly, it is estimated by measuring the contribution of gesture to understanding other discourse phenomena. More speciﬁcally, we bootstrap from multimodal coreference resolution to identify gestures that improve performance. We then select keyframes that capture these gestures. Our model predicts gesture salience as a hidden variable in a conditional framework, with observable features from both the visual and textual modalities. This approach signiﬁcantly outperforms competitive baselines that do not use gesture information.},

A closer scrutiny of design experiments shows that they share the basic linear methodology of traditional randomized controlled trials, and thus ignore resistance and agency of learners as a source of surprise and novelty. Formative interventions based on Vygotsky’s principle of double stimulation offer an alternative that builds on and purposefully fosters learners’ agency. Formative interventions may be characterized with the help of an argumentative grammar which proposes (a) the collective activity system as a unit of analysis, (b) contradictions as a source of change and development, (c) agency as a crucial layer of causality, and (d) transformation of practice as a form of expansive concept formation. These four epistemic tenets are concretized with the help of analysis of data from a Change Laboratory formative experiment conducted in a Finnish hospital. The analysis shows that double stimulation is a multi-layered and longitudinal process in which both the initial problem situation (first stimulus) and the mediating conceptual tool (second stimulus) are reformulated and enriched in successive steps. Such a process of double stimulation generates a thirdness, a new concept for the activity under transformation.},

In Study 1, high school students took three different tests and provided estimates of their performance both before and after taking each test.

Verbalizing information is shown to affect cognitive processes only if the instructions require verbalization of information that would not otherwise be attended to. From an analysis of what would be in {STM} at the time of report, the model predicts what could be reliably reported. The inaccurate reports found by other research are shown to result from requesting information that was never directly heeded, thus forcing Ss to infer rather than remember their mental processes.

Participants in the quasiexperimental study included 61 students and measures included the {IMMS} Survey as well as pre-, post-, and delayed-post-achievement tests. Findings support claims that technology use within a mathematics lesson increases student achievement, and augmented reality enhances student motivation to learn mathematics. However, analyzing the impact of technology use on student conceptual and technical use of mathematics shows varying outcomes emphasizing the need for continued exploration to determine the impact of technology use not only on overall mathematical achievement, but also on the specific type of mathematical activity, technical or conceptual.},

Implementation of our test leads to interesting new examples, among them: cones that have a {HILBERT} {PARTITION} but no {REGULAR} one; a four-dimensional cone with unimodular facets that has no {HILBERT} {PARTITION}; and two five-dimensional cones that do not have any {BINARY} {HILBERT} {COVER}.},

The “modelling cycle under cognitive psychological aspects” is specifically emphasized in contrast to the other cycles. On the basis of the results of the {COM}²-project (Cognitive psychological analysis of modelling processes in mathematics lessons, Borromeo Ferri) the phases of the modelling process are described empirically.

This paper argues that part of the connection is rhetorical. Quantitative methods express the assumptions of a positvisit paradigm which holds that behavior can be explained through objective facts. Design and instrumentation persuade by showing how bias and error are eliminated. Qualitative methods express the assumptions of a phenomenological paradigm that there are multiple realities that are socially defined. Rich description persuades by showing that the researcher was immersed in the setting and giving the reader enough detail to ?make sense? of the situation. While rhetorically different, the results of the two methodologies can be complementary. Examples are drawn from two studies using different methodologies to study the same problem.},

In this study, we draw on the concept of an example space (Mason \& Watson, 2008) and variation theory (Runesson in Scandinavian Journal of Educational Research 50:397–410, 2006) to create a lens to study how examples are used for pedagogical purposes in undergraduate proof-based instruction. We adapted the construct of an example space and extended its application to the constructs of example neighborhood, methods of example construction, and the functions of examples. We explained how to use our new lens to analyze the collection of examples and non-examples that the students had access to. We then demonstrate our method by analyzing the collection of examples and non-examples of a mathematical group the professor of an abstract algebra class presented during lectures or assigned to students in problem sets or exams.},

Following 7040 students from 3rd to 8th grades, we examined gender differences in math confidence, interest, and performance and examined relations among these variables over time. Results indicate that gender differences in math confidence are larger than disparities in interest and achievement in elementary school. Structural equation models show that math performance is a consistent predictor of later confidence and interest, and there is some evidence for a reciprocal relation between confidence and performance in middle school. Relations were generally similar for boys and girls. Results raise questions about the notion that early gender differences in math interest are a driver of disparities in later math outcomes and instead suggest that math interventions for girls should begin early and include attention to math confidence, in addition to achievement.},

        Γ
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}Gamma \}
  , the capital letter gamma from the Greek alphabet) is one commonly used extension of the factorial function to complex numbers. The gamma function is defined for all complex numbers except the non-positive integers.  For any positive integer 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle n\}

        .
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}Gamma (n)=(n-1)!{\textbackslash} .\}
  Derived by Daniel Bernoulli, for complex numbers with a positive real part the gamma function is defined via a convergent improper integral:

  
    
      
        Γ
        (
        z
        )
        =

            0
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        
          x
          
            z
            −
            1
          
        
        
          e
          
            −
            x
          
        
        
        d
        x
        ,
         
        
        ℜ
        (
        z
        )
        {\textgreater}
        0
         
        .
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}Gamma (z)={\textbackslash}int \_\{0\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}infty \}x{\textasciicircum}\{z-1\}e{\textasciicircum}\{-x\}{\textbackslash},dx,{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}qquad {\textbackslash}Re (z){\textgreater}0{\textbackslash} .\}
  The gamma function then is defined as the analytic continuation of this integral function to a meromorphic function that is holomorphic in the whole complex plane except the non-positive integers, where the function has simple poles. 
The gamma function has no zeroes, so the reciprocal gamma function 
  
    
      
        1
        
          /
        
        Γ
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle 1/{\textbackslash}Gamma \}
   is an entire function. In fact, the gamma function corresponds to the Mellin transform of the negative exponential function:

  
    
      
        Γ
        (
        z
        )
        =
        \{
        
          
            M
          
        
        
          e
          
            −
            x
          
        
        \}
        (
        z
        )
        .
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}Gamma (z)={\textbackslash}\{\{{\textbackslash}mathcal \{M\}\}e{\textasciicircum}\{-x\}{\textbackslash}\}(z).\}
  Other extensions of the factorial function do exist, but the gamma function is the most popular and useful. It is a component in various probability-distribution functions, and as such it is applicable in the fields of probability and statistics, as well as combinatorics.},

Data were analysed through the use of two conceptual lenses which were synthesised from literature related to levels of teacher reﬂection and teacher change. The analysis suggests that video-stimulated recall can be an effective medium for promoting teacher professional learning, providing quality reﬂection and questioning are included as crucial elements of the processes.},

Our preliminary analyses of student interviews and classroom interactions reveal that social networks are instrumental in shaping learning opportunities and the development of academic, mathematical, and racial identities of girls in this third-grade class. To conclude, we use this study to discuss our view of researching African American girls in learning contexts.},

The topics covered in these new essays are women in the play, the play's debt to contemporary theater, its critical and performance histories in Germany and Japan, the metrical variety of the play, and the distinctly modern perspective on the play as containing dark and disturbing elements. To compliment these new essays, the collection features significant scholarship and commentary on The Comedy of Errors that is published in obscure and difficulty accessible journals, newspapers, and other sources.

First, we re-present a paper given at a conference on the performing arts of people with ‘learning dif culties’, where the audience was made up of performers, workers, providers and researchers. This paper attempted to be accessible, theoretical, political and practical. Secondly, we re ect upon this paper in relation to seven points of analysis that emerge at the boundaries of disability politics and disability research.

Both the medical and economic definitions have relied primarily on clinical methods. Whereas the medical approach has been operationally measured by limits on major life activities, the economic orientation has been measured by restrictions on the amount or kind of work that can be performed. By contrast, the sociopolitical definition, which focuses on the interaction between the individual and the environment, can be empirically assessed by measures of visibility and labeling. Self-identification is also an important index of the relative size and political strength of disabled persons. Because of the significance of new antidiscrimination laws, which appear to be based on the minority-group model, there is a pressing need to grant operational measures of the sociopolitical definition a position of parity in relation to the vast amount of data that have already been accumulated through the use of medical and economic concepts in government and other surveys.},

Additionally, we identified which math beliefs (and which theory) best explained variance in math behaviors and performance by college students and which students were most likely to have problematic math beliefs. Study participants included 368 college math students who completed questionnaires to report math behaviors (attending class, doing homework, reading textbooks, asking for help) and used a 5-point rating scale to indicate a variety of math beliefs. For a subset of 84 students, math professors provided final math grades. Factor analyses produced a 10-item Math Value Scale with 2 subscales (Class Devaluation, No Future Value), a 7-item single-dimension Math Confidence Scale, and an 11-item Math Barriers Scale with 2 subscales (Math Anxiety, Discouraging Words). Hierarchical multiple regression revealed that high levels of the newly discovered class devaluation belief (guided by expectancy-value theory) were most consistently associated with poor math behaviors in college students, with high math anxiety (guided by health belief model) and low math confidence (guided by self-efficacy theory) also found to be significant. Analyses of covariance revealed that younger and male students were at increased risk for class devaluation and older students were at increased risk for poor math confidence.},

Increasingly, those concerned with education policy and practice are shifting priorities toward supporting deeper learning by emphasizing the importance of students’ ability to apply knowledge in subject areas. Designers of student assessments are following suit and are taking on the challenge of creating a new generation of assessments. We present a principled approach for designing classroom-based assessments that not only assess deeper learning, but also provide teachers with critical information about how students are progressing toward achieving ambitious new learning goals. Our approach follows the evidentiary reasoning of evidence-centered design and builds on research about the important role of knowledge-in-use to support student learning. We illustrate our approach in the context of creating tasks that assess students’ science proficiency as reflected in the Next Generation Science Standards that are gaining prominence in the United States.},

Cohen described an adaptation with less explicit competition suitable for undergraduate students at a liberal arts college. This article details an adaptation of this modified Moore method to teach mathematical statistics, and describes ways that such an approach helps engage students and foster the teaching of statistics. Groups of students worked a set of three difficult problems (some theoretical, some applied) every two weeks. Class time was devoted to coaching sessions with the instructor, group meeting time, and class presentations. R was used to estimate solutions empirically, where analytic results were intractable, as well as to provide an environment to undertake simulation studies with the aim of deepening understanding and complementing analytic solutions. Each group presented comprehensive solutions to complement oral presentations. Development of parallel techniques for empirical and analytic problem solving was an explicit goal of the course, which also attempted to communicate ways that statistics can be used to tackle interesting problems. The group problem-solving component and use of technology allowed students to attempt much more challenging questions than they could otherwise solve.

This study takes a qualitative approach building on the work of a 13-year-old girl as an exemplary case of the nature of young students’ spontaneous mathematical problem solving with technology. The empirical data comprise digital records of her approaches to two problems from a web-based mathematical competition where she resorted to {GeoGebra} and an interview where she explains and describes her usual problem solving activity with this tool. Based on a proposed model for describing the processes of mathematical problem solving with technologies ({MPST}), the main results show that this student’s solving and expressing the solution are held from the early and continuing interplay between mathematical skills and the perception of the affordances of the tool. The analytical model offers a clear picture of the type of actions that lead to the solution of each problem, revealing the student’s ability to deal with mathematics and technology in problem solving. By acknowledging this as a case of a human-withmedia in solving mathematical problems, the students’ efficient way of merging technological and mathematical knowledge is portrayed in terms of her technomathematical fluency.},

	abstract = {Teacher education programs typically teach novices about one part of teaching at a time. We might offer courses on different topics—cultural foundations, learning theory, or classroom management—or we may parse teaching practice itself into a set of discrete techniques, such as core teaching practices, that can be taught individually. Missing from our courses is attention to the ultimate purpose of these discrete parts—how specific concepts can help teachers achieve their goals, or how specific procedures can help them achieve their goals. Because we are now shifting from a focus on bodies of knowledge to a focus on depictions of practice, this article examines our efforts to parse teaching practice into lists of discrete procedures. It argues that we need to pay less attention to the visible behaviors of teaching and more attention to the purposes that are served by those behaviors. As a way to begin a conversation about parsing teachers’ purposes, I offer a proposal for conceptualizing teaching as a practice that entails five persistent problems, each of which presents a difficult challenge to teachers, and all of which compete for teachers’ attention. Viewed in this way, the role of teacher education is not to offer solutions to these problems, but instead to help novices learn to analyze these problems and to evaluate alternative courses of action for how well they address these problems.},

Drawing on research across domains of science, math, and language learning, we illustrate the analyses of knowledge, learning, and instructional events that the {KLI} framework affords. We present a set of three coordinated taxonomies of knowledge, learning, and instruction. For example, we identify three broad classes of learning events ({LEs}): (a) memory and ﬂuency processes, (b) induction and reﬁnement processes, and (c) understanding and sense-making processes, and we show how these can lead to different knowledge changes and constraints on optimal instructional choices.},

In this paper, I will describe how these myths have developed, and identify research that counters these myths. I argue that these myths are the unintended consequences of deﬁcit constructions of students with Learning Disabilities in educational research. Using neurodiversity to frame disability as diversity rather than deﬁcit, I assert that students with Learning Disabilities can learn mathematics to the highest levels, and that these limiting mythologies hold them back.},

	shorttitle = {Cognition in Practice},
	abstract = {Most previous research on human cognition has focused on problem-solving, and has confined its investigations to the laboratory. As a result, it has been difficult to account for complex mental processes and their place in culture and history. In this startling - indeed, disco in forting - study, Jean Lave moves the analysis of one particular form of cognitive activity, - arithmetic problem-solving - out of the laboratory into the domain of everyday life. In so doing, she shows how mathematics in the 'real world', like all thinking, is shaped by the dynamic encounter between the culturally endowed mind and its total context, a subtle interaction that shapes 1) Both tile human subject and the world within which it acts. The study is focused on mundane daily, activities, such as grocery shopping for 'best buys' in the supermarket, dieting, and so on. Innovative in its method, fascinating in its findings, the research is above all significant in its theoretical contributions. Have offers a cogent critique of conventional cognitive theory, turning for an alternative to recent social theory, and weaving a compelling synthesis from elements of culture theory, theories of practice, and Marxist discourse. The result is a new way of understanding human thought processes, a vision of cognition as the dialectic between persons-acting, and the settings in which their activity is constituted. The book will appeal to anthropologists, for its novel theory of the relation of cognition to culture and context; to cognitive scientists and educational theorists; and to the 'plain folks' who form its subject, and who will recognize themselves in it, a rare accomplishment in the modern social sciences.},

	title = {Pragmatism},
	url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2019/entries/pragmatism/},
	abstract = {Pragmatism is a philosophical tradition that – very broadly– understands knowing the world as inseparable from agencywithin it. This general idea has attracted a remarkably richand at times contrary range of interpretations, including: that allphilosophical concepts should be tested via scientificexperimentation, that a claim is true if and only if it is useful(relatedly: if a philosophical theory does not contribute directly tosocial progress then it is not worth much), that experience consistsin transacting with rather than representing nature, that articulatelanguage rests on a deep bed of shared human practices that can neverbe fully ‘made explicit’. , Pragmatism originated in the United States around 1870, and nowpresents a growing third alternative to both analytic and‘Continental’ philosophical traditions worldwide. Itsfirst generation was initiated by the so-called ‘classicalpragmatists’ Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914), who firstdefined and defended the view, and his close friend and {colleagueWilliam} James (1842–1910), who further developed and ablypopularized it. During this initial period, pragmatists focusedsignificantly on theorising inquiry, meaning and the nature of truth,although James put these themes to work exploring truth in religion. Asecond (still termed ‘classical’) generation turnedpragmatist philosophy more explicitly towards politics, education andother dimensions of social improvement, under the immense influence {ofJohn} Dewey (1859–1952) and his friend Jane Addams(1860–1935) – who invented the profession of social workas an expression of pragmatist ideas (and was awarded the Nobel {PeacePrize} in 1931). Also of considerable importance at this time {wasGeorge} Herbert Mead (1863–1931), who contributed significantlyto the social sciences, developing pragmatist perspectives upon therelations between the self and the community (Mead 1934). As theresulting progressive Deweyan ‘New Deal’ era passed awayand the {US} moved into the Cold War, pragmatism’s influence waschallenged, as analytic philosophy blossomed and became the dominantmethodological orientation in most Anglo-American philosophydepartments.  Transitional or ‘third generation’ figuresincluded C.I. Lewis and W.V.O. Quine; although these philosophersdeveloped a number of pragmatist themes, their analytic allegiance maybe seen in their significant focus on theory of knowledge as firstphilosophy (which Dewey deprecated as ‘the epistemologicalindustry’)., Following this dip in popularity, since the 1970s the pragmatisttradition has undergone a significant revival. Richard Rorty(1931–2007) turned consciously to pragmatism to rectify what he saw as mainstream epistemology’s crucial mistake: naively conceiving oflanguage and thought as ‘mirroring’ the world.Rorty’s bold and iconoclastic attacks on this‘representationalism’ birthed a so-calledneopragmatism to which a number of influential recentphilosophers have contributed (e.g. Hilary Putnam, Robert Brandom {andHuw} Price). Other pragmatists have objected to Rorty’s blithedismissal of truth as a topic better left undiscussed (Rorty 1982),and have sought to rehabilitate classical pragmatist ideals ofobjectivity (e.g. Susan Haack, Christopher Hookway and Cheryl Misak).These philosophers are now sometimes referred to as {NewPragmatists}. Yet others have worked to place pragmatist ideas in abroader Western philosophical context, for instance {tracingPeirce}’s significant debt to Kant (Apel 1974, Gava 2014), andconnections between pragmatism and 19th century idealism (Margolis2010, Stern 2009). Meanwhile, classical pragmatism’s progressivesocial ideals lived on in some quarters, with notable contributions tophilosophy of race made by Cornel West, who advanced a propheticpragmatism drawing on both Christian and Marxian thought (e.g.West 1989). A number of other liberatory philosophical projects inareas such as feminism (Seigfried 1996), ecology (Alexander 2013),Native American philosophy (Pratt 2002) and Latin American philosophy(Pappas 1998) also currently look to the pragmatist tradition as theirphilosophical home. , Meanwhile, increasingly pragmatism’s intellectual centre ofgravity is moving out of North America, with vibrant research networksappearing in South America, Scandinavia and more recently {centralEurope} and China. , The core of pragmatism as Peirce originally conceived it was {thePragmatic} Maxim, a rule for clarifying the meaning of hypotheses bytracing their ‘practical consequences’ – theirimplications for experience in specific situations. For Peirce {andJames}, a key application of the Maxim was clarifying the conceptof truth. This produced a distinctive epistemological outlook:a fallibilist, anti-Cartesian explication of the norms that governinquiry. Within that broad outlook, though, early pragmatists splitsignificantly over questions of realism broadly conceived– essentially, whether pragmatism should conceive itself as ascientific philosophy holding monism about truth (following Peirce),or a more broad-based alethic pluralism (following James {andDewey}). This dispute was poignantly emblematized in arguments {betweenPeirce} and James which led Peirce to rename hisview pragmaticism, presenting this clarified viewpoint to theworld as his new ‘baby’ which was, he hoped, ‘uglyenough to be safe from kidnappers’ ({EP}2: 355)., The first part of this entry is devoted to the classicalpragmatists’ distinctive methods, and how they give rise to anoriginal a posteriori epistemology. After that we will briefly exploresome of the many other areas of philosophy in which rich pragmatistcontributions have been made.},

Mathematical truths are therefore discovered, notinvented., The most important argument for the existence of abstractmathematical objects derives from Gottlob Frege and goes as follows(Frege 1953). The language of mathematics purports to refer to andquantify over abstract mathematical objects. And a great number ofmathematical theorems are true. But a sentence cannot be true unlessits sub-expressions succeed in doing what they purport to do. So thereexist abstract mathematical objects that these expressions refer to andquantify over., Frege’s argument notwithstanding, philosophers have developed avariety of objections to mathematical platonism. Thus, abstract mathematical objects are claimed to be epistemologically inaccessible and metaphysically problematic. Mathematical platonism has been amongthe most hotly debated topics in the philosophy of mathematics over thepast few decades.},

	abstract = {Virtual worlds and environments are becoming an increasingly central part of our lives, yet they are still far from accessible to the blind. This is especially unfortunate as such environments hold great potential for them for uses such as social interaction, online education and especially for use with familiarizing the visually impaired user with a real environment virtually from the comfort and safety of his own home before visiting it in the real world. We have implemented a simple algorithm to improve this situation using single-point depth information, enabling the blind to use a virtual cane, modeled on the “{EyeCane}” electronic travel aid, within any virtual environment with minimal preprocessing. Use of the Virtual-{EyeCane}, enables this experience to potentially be later used in real world environments with identical stimuli to those from the virtual environment. We show the fast-learned practical use of this algorithm for navigation in simple environments.},

Firstly, we observed how teachers learn these processes and subsequently identify what and how to assess learners on the same processes. Secondly, we reviewed one teacher’s attempt to facilitate the learning of the processes in his classroom. Two interrelated questions were pursued: ‘what are the teachers’ challenges in learning mathematical processes?’ and ‘in what ways are teachers’ approaches to learning mathematical processes influencing how they assess their learners on the same processes?’ A case study was undertaken involving 10 high school mathematics teachers who enrolled for an assessment module towards a Bachelor in Education Honours degree in mathematics education. We present an interpretive analysis of two sets of data. The first set consisted of the teachers’ written responses to a pattern searching activity. The second set consisted of a mathematical discourse on matchstick patterns in a Grade 9 class. The overall finding was that teachers rush through forms of representation and focus more on manipulation of numerical representations with a view to deriving symbolic representation. Subsequently, this unidirectional approach limits the scope of assessment of mathematical processes. Interventions with regard to the enhancement of these complex processes should involve teachers’ actual engagements in and reflections on similar learning.},

This special issue integrates ideas and efforts across different fields into a more unified framework to study and design for what we call Learning on the Move. Approaches used in these studies reflect various ontological and epistemological standpoints, especially with regard to the role of moving bodies, place, and lands/waters in learning, teaching, and development. The heterogeneity of approaches in this special issue potentially helps us to see the complexity of human, more-than-human, and technological relations across time. The specificity of each project necessarily foregrounds certain aspects of activity and history, while backgrounding others. Rather than casting this as problematic, we see this heterogeneity as an opportunity to generate dialogue across research programs that are guided by frameworks of power, historicity, relationality, respect, reciprocity, and accountability. We also take this as an opportunity to raise questions about historical, present-day, and future relationships to lands/waters, place, socio-ecological systems, and socio-technical arrangements. At a practical level, this means having conversations about the differences and similarities between ontological and epistemological conceptions of time, space, place, and lands/waters when studying or designing for Learning on the Move. We anticipate and acknowledge that at times our conceptions of Learning on the Move may align and at other times may be incommensurable.},

	abstract = {The underrepresentation of women (and men of color) in science has motivated many science educators to develop innovate classroom pedagogies aimed at making science courses and curricula more attractive and inviting to all students. One dominant approach to reforming science education is to transform how students learn by implementing collaborative approaches to learning in the classroom. Feminist pedagogy is an alternative approach to science education reform that is concerned with transforming both how students of science learn and the science curriculum that students are expected to learn. This article ﬁrst compares and contrasts collaborative learning and feminist pedagogy. It then addresses the implications and consequences of each for science education. The theoretical and epistemological foundations of each approach demonstrates that choosing a classroom pedagogy is not an apolitical act. Collaborative approaches to science education serve to reproduce the dominant discourse of existing science systems. In contrast, feminist pedagogy resists the dominant discourse and invites all students to learn science, but more important, it invites them also to critically analyze existing scientiﬁc systems and the relationship of those systems to power, oppression, and domination.

Results from four pre-registered studies (N = 1518) indicate that manipulating awe through online (Studies 1a, 1b, and 1c) and virtual reality (Study 2) videos, led to greater awareness of knowledge gaps. Awareness of knowledge gaps was consistently associated with greater science interest and to choosing tickets to a science museum over tickets to an art museum (Study 1b). These eﬀects were not consistently observed on, nor moderated by, other measures related to cognition, religion, and spirituality. However, exploratory analyses showed that science interest was better predicted by positive emotions than by awe. Still, these results provide the ﬁrst empirical evidence of awe as an “epistemic emotion” by demonstrating its eﬀects on awareness of knowledge gaps. These ﬁndings are also extended to the eﬀects of awe on science interest as one possible outcome of awareness of knowledge gaps.},

We aim to close this gap by designing a learning-companion robot to augment guided reading activity and examine the robot’s impact on an in-home reading experience. In this paper, we compare the experiences of early adolescent children aged 10 to 12 (N = 24) who either completed guided reading activities with a learning-companion robot or as a paper-based activity in a two-week long, in-home field study. We found similar reading frequency and duration in both conditions and that both guided reading activities were described as positive experiences that help build reading skill and sustain engagement. Children who read with the learning-companion robot further reported that the activities supported reading comprehension and motivated them to read and indicated a deepening social connection (i.e., companionship or affiliation) with the robot. We conclude that rather than the activity falling off after a novelty effect, our simple prototype social robot is capable of preserving the benefits of an existing in-home learning activity while transforming the reading experience into a valuable, social one. Our findings contribute to an understanding of how we might capitalize on the capacity of social robots to serve as a transformative learning tool as robots become more widely available to the public.},

In 1988 the University of Texas at Austin ({UT}) established the Emerging Scholars Program ({ESP}) to challenge high-achieving students to excel in calculus and pursue mathematics, science, or engineering ({MSE}) majors. The university makes a special effort to recruit African Americans, Latinos, and women, but the {ESP} is open to any student, regardless of race or ethnicity, who is committed to excel in calculus. We analyze the influence of calculus performance on choosing a mathematics, science, or engineering major by focusing on variations by race, ethnicity, and gender and on the role of students' participation in the {ESP}. Findings suggest that {ESP} students earn higher calculus grades than non-{ESP} students and are more likely to enroll in the second semester of calculus. Also, earning higher calculus grades increases the likelihood that students will choose a major in mathematics, science, or engineering. These findings suggest that to increase the number of students choosing one of these majors, administrators must seek ways to increase students' participation in calculus each semester. In addition, African Americans, Latinos, and women excel in calculus if they receive appropriate academic challenges and support.},

This study examines how a justicecentered advanced chemistry class in an urban neighborhood high school supported students to succeed academically while taking up urgent issues of social and environmental justice identiﬁed by their communities. The ﬁndings include evidence that curriculum organized around an issue of environmental racism supported academic achievement that exceeded the expectations of a typical high school chemistry course. The ﬁndings also document how the curriculum provided opportunities for students to move beyond academic achievement to position themselves as transformative intellectuals. As transformative intellectuals, students demonstrated complex thinking about science and social justice issues, cultivated their commitment to their communities and cultures of origin, and developed credibility as local youth knowledgeable in science.

	abstract = {In the ongoing effort of designing school contexts in support of proactive discipline, a range of practices and theoretical frameworks have been advanced, from behaviorist approaches to social and emotional learning. This article describes the theory and practice of restorative justice with the aim of defining this distinctive paradigm, in comparison to other forms of discipline, as one that uniquely emphasizes social engagement over social control. In so doing, a responsive regulatory framework supports pedagogy, praxis, and discipline such that relational school cultures are nurtured; wherein, behavior is understood in social context, individuals are recognized as being part of a social web of relations, and building, maintaining, and repairing relationships become priorities. This focus on developing rich and embedded relational ecologies finds its strength through nurturing motivational bonds of belonging that support individual development and social responsibility. This is distinct from formal institutional responses that rely on systems of institutional sanctions to leverage compliance.},

This occurs through a process of transduction that promotes valuable mathematical insights by eliciting dynamic depictive gestures that enact spatio-temporal properties of mathematical entities. Our focus here is on pre-college geometry proof production. {GEMC} suggests that action alone can foster insight but is insufficient for valid proof production if action is not coordinated with language systems for propositionalizing general properties of objects and space. {GEMC} guides the design of a video game-based learning environment intended to promote students’ mathematical insights and informal proofs by eliciting dynamic gestures through in-game directed actions.},

	abstract = {There are many reasons to be curious about the way people learn, and the past several decades have seen an explosion of research that has important implications for individual learning, schooling, workforce training, and policy.
In 2000, How People Learn: Brain, Mind, Experience, and School: Expanded Edition was published and its influence has been wide and deep. The report summarized insights on the nature of learning in school-aged children; described principles for the design of effective learning environments; and provided examples of how that could be implemented in the classroom.
Since then, researchers have continued to investigate the nature of learning and have generated new findings related to the neurological processes involved in learning, individual and cultural variability related to learning, and educational technologies. In addition to expanding scientific understanding of the mechanisms of learning and how the brain adapts throughout the lifespan, there have been important discoveries about influences on learning, particularly sociocultural factors and the structure of learning environments.
How People Learn {II}: Learners, Contexts, and Cultures provides a much-needed update incorporating insights gained from this research over the past decade. The book expands on the foundation laid out in the 2000 report and takes an in-depth look at the constellation of influences that affect individual learning. How People Learn {II} will become an indispensable resource to understand learning throughout the lifespan for educators of students and adults.},

	abstract = {Educational environment inﬂuences students’ learning attitudes, and the classroom conveys the educational philosophy. The traditional college classroom design is based on the educational space that ﬁrst appeared in medieval universities. Since then classrooms have not changed except in their size. In an attempt to develop a different perspective of educational environment, a new design of classroom, the active learning classroom ({ALC}), was established at {SoongSil} University in Korea. Two questionnaire surveys were conducted for diagnosing the educational effects of students’ learning in the {ALC} and comparing the results with those obtained regarding the traditional classroom. The result proved the existence of a ‘golden zone’ and a ‘shadow zone’ in the traditional classroom, which discriminate students’ learning experiences depending on seating positions. On the contrary, the {ALC} did not produce such positional discrimination. Students perceived the {ALC} environment as more inspirational, especially in regards to active class participation. Students with more emphasis on academic achievement showed greater tendency to share information and to create new ideas in the {ALC}. However, in the traditional classroom setting, only students with high {GPAs} were more motivated to learn while the gap in learning attitudes was offset in the {ALC} setting. In-depth discussions about research ﬁndings were undertaken and four suggestions were provided in support of school administrators and relevant institutional personnel, faculty members, and researchers for future utilization of the {ALC}.},

We organize our review into three thematic categories: (1) the dynamic construction of identity and ideology, (2) attending to the organization of a learning environment, and (3) leveraging and repurposing tools. Reading across these thematic areas, we identify and outline a burgeoning subfield that we term critical interaction and microgenetic analysis. By bringing this collection of articles together, this chapter provides collective epistemic and empirical weight to claims of power and learning as co-constituted and co-constructed through interactional, microgenetic, and structural dynamics. In our conclusions, we suggest six analytical commitments that are important to hold when engaging in critical interaction and microgenetic analysis.},

This paper addresses these topics by analyzing 26 publications that have previously compared student learning in {AR} versus non-{AR} applications. It identiﬁes a list of positive and negative impacts of {AR} experiences on student learning and highlights factors that are potentially underlying these effects. This set of factors is argued to cause differences in educational effectiveness between {AR} and other media.

In this project, we have designed a Hololensbased system in which collaborators are exposed to an unstructured learning activity in which they learned about the invisible physics involved in audio speakers. They learned topics ranging from spatial knowledge, such as shape of magnetic fields, to abstract conceptual knowledge, such as relationships between electricity and magnetism. We compared participants’ learning, attitudes and collaboration with a tangible interface through multiple experimental conditions containing varying layers of {AR} information. We found that educational {AR} representations were beneficial for learning specific knowledge and increasing participants’ self-efficacy (i.e., their ability to learn concepts in physics). However, we also found that participants in conditions that did not contain {AR} educational content, learned some concepts better than other groups and became more curious about physics. We discuss learning and collaboration differences, as well as benefits and detriments of implementing augmented reality for unstructured learning activities.},

We offer the model as a tool for researchers and change agents who wish to study and enact systemic change within {STEM} departments. We provide the four frames in contrast to overly simplistic models of change that have been shown to be unlikely to result in sustainable improvements. As we outline the four frames, we discuss both how the frames provide insight into potential products for change and how they influence the process of change. We provide an extended example of how the four frames can be used to analyze an existing change effort and implications of this approach for future work. Conclusions: This paper adapts a model for promoting and understanding change efforts in {STEM} departments. This is a model that can be used by nearly any researcher or administrator to help increase the impact of their work.},

This case study has been carried out with a view to replying the question of how we can make the subject of integers, which students in the 6th grades find too difficult to learn, easier and more permanent. The subject of Integers is one of the most difficult subjects that students have difficulty in grasping because they have only learnt natural numbers in Math. In general, when students come across a new number system, they have difficulty in learning it. Also, as they haven’t conceptualized the subject, they do not like the subject and cannot correlate the mathematical links. However, as teachers and mathematics educators, our duty is to make our students enjoy the subject of integers and ensure its retention. For this purpose, so as to eliminate the problems faced during the learning process, we have tried to conceptualize the subject by employing new software, Geogebra, by which we aim to provide a permanent learning for our students.},

Being responsive to student thinking involves attending to the substance of students’ ideas—the meaning students are making—and pursuing that thinking, adjusting the flow of instruction as needed. Yet, attention and responsiveness to student thinking is irregular and generally rare among novice teachers. In this theoretical paper, we argue that the irregularity of attention and responsiveness to student thinking, including variability within individual teachers’ practice, can be explained by a framework grounded in teachers’ localized framings of their classroom activity—their sense of “what is it that’s going on here.” Using analyses of classroom episodes across contexts and timescales to illustrate our claims, we demonstrate how a framing-anchored framework can coordinate and improve upon three common explanations for the irregularity of novice teachers’ attention and responsiveness to student thinking: underdeveloped skills and/or knowledge for attending and responding, “transmissionist” beliefs about learning, and institutional constraints (and teachers’ perceptions thereof). Building on this argument, we suggest that teacher educators can work with novice teachers’ framings of their classroom activities as a generative anchor for supporting attention and responsiveness to student thinking in classroom settings.},

In mathematics classroom, {ICT} can help students and teachers to perform calculation, analyse data, explore mathematical concepts thus increasing the understanding in mathematics. This quasi-experimental study with non-equivalent control group post-test only design was conducted to examine the effects of using a free-software called {GeoGebra} in the learning of Coordinate Geometry among students classified as high visual-spatial ability students ({HV}) and low visual-spatial ability students ({LV}). The Spatial Visualization Ability Test Instrument ({SVATI}) had been used to categorize the students in different spatial ability level. A total of 53 secondary school students in Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur participated in the study. They were assigned into two different groups. One group was taught Coordinate Geometry using {GeoGebra} while the other underwent learning the traditional way. Students’ mathematics achievement was measured using post test at the end of the intervention. The test format was based on Additional Mathematics {KBSM} syllabus. Independent samples t-test results showed that there was a significant difference in mean mathematical achievement between the {GeoGebra} group (M=65.23, {SD}=19.202) and the traditional teaching strategy group (M=54.7, {SD}=15.660); [t (51) = 2.259, p= .028 {\textless} .05]. This study also found that the {HV} students performed better than the {LV} students in both group. Findings showed that there were no significant different among {HV} students between {GeoGebra} group and traditional group. Meanwhile the {LV} students in {GeoGebra} group (M=64.07, {SD}=21.569) significantly outperformed the {LV} students in traditional group (M=48.79, {SD}=15.106); [t (51) = 2.222, p= .036 {\textless} .05]. These findings showed that the use of {GeoGebra} enhanced the students’ performance in learning Coordinate Geometry.},

	abstract = {Augmented Reality ({AR}) is recognized as one of the most important developments in educational technology for both higher and K-12 education as emphasized in Horizon report (Johnson et al., 2016, 2015). Furthermore, {AR} is expected to achieve widespread adoption that will take two to three years in higher education and four to five years in K-12 education (Johnson et al., 2016, 2012). If this is the current state of the art for the use of {AR} in education, it is important to investigate how educators and researchers integrate {AR} into teaching-learning processes. Looking from such a glimpse, the purpose of this scoping review was to provide a comprehensive overview of relevant research regarding the emergence of augmented reality, the links to pedagogy and educational outcomes, specifically in the context of formal education. The scoping review is underpinned by the five-stage framework Arksey and O’Malley (2005). First, research questions are identified. Second, the last five years in {ERIC} database is explored by using the search term ‘augmented reality.’ Third, studies are investigated through inclusion and exclusion criteria, and {PRISMA} (2009) model is utilized for article selection. Fourth, selected articles are charted with respect to numerous dimensions and summaries. Finally, findings are reported in the light of research questions. The findings of the scoping review illustrated a set of studies that provide evidence of improved academic performance, increase in students’ engagement, motivation, and satisfaction through the educational environments that are enriched with {AR} applications. The findings of the scoping review are discussed with respect to multiple dimensions that are explored under research questions.},

Learners are expected to articulate, develop, and defend their ideas and respond to the ideas of others. Decades of prior research have carefully documented features, processes, and potential benefits and shortcomings of an emphasis on talk in science learning. Yet, the task of documenting change in learners’ talk over time remains a major methodological challenge. To address this challenge, we examine one Korean immigrant girl’s (Selena) oral participation during an informal science learning program called Science Club. Quantitative analysis showed that, over time, Selena spoke more often and for longer. However, fine‐grained qualitative analysis of features of her talk (e.g., use of a variety of bids and hedges) demonstrated Selena’s persistent desire to share ideas, even though the intellectual merits of those ideas went largely unacknowledged. Methodologically, Selena’s case illustrates the importance of considering multiple features of learner talk, understood in the social context, when making claims about changes in oral participation over time. Pedagogically, Selena’s case highlights the importance of teachers’ attention to how learners’ ideas are taken up, in addition to how frequently they are speaking in class.},

In response, mathematics departments have instituted courses, introduction or transition to proof, designed to help students learn how to prove. Existing research has extensively examined students' errors, struggles, and some of their strategies at a given point in time, but we know little about students' development over a longer period of time. There is a need for longitudinal work in this area, to follow students through the transition to proof. In addition, little is known about the affective side of proving (e.g., attitudes, beliefs, emotions). Affect plays a central role in mathematics learning, influencing students' cognitive processes while problem solving and their motivation to value and want to do mathematics. Understanding affective issues are important, as students consider their future participation in mathematical work and communities. Positive experiences at transitional junctions, such as learning how to prove, are crucial for retention of students through the {STEM} (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) pipeline. The purpose of this work was to explore the cognitive and affective factors involved in undergraduates' efforts to learn how to prove: how their proving developed during a transition to proof course and what kinds of "satisfying moments," i.e. positive emotional reactions, they experienced. Four semi-structured interviews across a semester were conducted with eleven undergraduate students enrolled in a transition to proof course. The resulting data was analyzed using qualitative methods. Findings indicate that students showed growth in fluency, strategy use, and monitoring and judgement over time. Four developments were frequently observed across the sample: (1) increased sophistication in students' rationales for choice of proof techniques, (2) awareness about how a solution attempt was going and managing that for their subsequent strategies, (3) intentional exploring and monitoring when unsure about what direction to pursue, and (4) checking examples in conjunction with other strategies as a way to become unstuck. The variety of developments--and the different ways in which they emerged--is significant, because it confirms that multiple developments occur in different ways, strongly suggesting that there is no one path that students take through the transition to proof. Students' satisfying moments were largely about accomplishments both with and without struggle, understanding, external validation, as well as interacting with others. A theory for how satisfying moments are elicited was proposed. Expectations and a sense of mastery played large roles in mediating satisfying moments, but students' desire for understanding and sense-making was also prominent. This work provides guidance for curriculum design of transition to proof courses, in considering how to support students' development in proving. In addition, examination of just what makes a satisfying moment satisfying is helpful in thinking about how to construct mathematical tasks with opportunities for positive experiences with math.

	abstract = {Gesture recognition opens up new ways for humans to intuitively interact with machines. Especially for service robots, gestures can be a valuable addition to the means of communication to, for example, draw the robot's attention to someone or something. Extracting a gesture from video data and classifying it is a challenging task and a variety of approaches have been proposed throughout the years. This paper presents a method for gesture recognition in {RGB} videos using {OpenPose} to extract the pose of a person and Dynamic Time Warping ({DTW}) in conjunction with One-Nearest-Neighbor (1NN) for time-series classification. The main features of this approach are the independence of any specific hardware and high flexibility, because new gestures can be added to the classifier by adding only a few examples of it. We utilize the robustness of the Deep Learning-based {OpenPose} framework while avoiding the data-intensive task of training a neural network ourselves. We demonstrate the classification performance of our method using a public dataset.},

	url = {http://hdl.handle.net/10027/22184},
	abstract = {This study was designed to better understand how new chemistry graduate students develop a teaching identity as {GTAs}. Specifically, this study considered two cases of first year chemistry graduate students engaging in teaching for the first time. Data sources included interviews, journals, classroom observations, and artifact ion collection. Classroom observations were used to describe the practices of the {GTAs} and when combined with the journals and interviews were used to develop an understanding of their identity development. The findings from the two cases produced descriptions of teaching practice, learning
environment factors that mediated the {GTA} teaching practices, and two different models of teaching identity for the new {GTAs}. Both {GTAs} began teaching with models of teaching identity drawn from their own experiences as students. In Case 1, the {GTA}’s model of teaching identity was labeled as helper. In Case 2, the {GTA}’s model of teaching identity was labeled as leader. I found that the discourse between the students and {GTAs} did not directly have evidence
of teaching identity. In a chemistry classroom, the {GTA}-student talk is centered on atoms, molecules, and reactions. I found evidence for understanding metapragmatic models of teaching identity in teaching practices and their interaction with learning environment factors. Five learning environment factors were identified in this study: Content, Worksheet structure, Mode of Instruction, Social interactions, and {GTA} observations. The description of the learning environment factors has methodological implications for expanding the usefulness of the Communities of Practice and Social Identification frameworks. In addition, learning environment factors and {GTA} teaching identity should be considered when developing training and
professional development for graduate students.},

Creating opportunities for students to persist in problem solving is therefore argued as essential to effective teaching and to children developing positive dispositions in mathematical learning.

Drawing on video of elementary school children in two {US} classrooms (n = 52), this paper offers: (1) empirical examples that define perseverance as collective enterprise; (2) indicators of perseverance for teachers (and researchers) to support (and study) its emergence; and (3) evidence of how the task, peer dynamics, and student-teacher interactions afford or constrain its occurrence. The significance of perseverance as collective enterprise and as an object of design in developing effective learning communities, is discussed.},

Compared to other theories, sociocultural theory offers a more powerful, integrative account of how motivational aspects of learning—such as self-regulation, self-efﬁcacy, sense of belonging, and identity—are completely entwined with cognitive development. Instead of centering assessment within systems that support use of interim and end-of-year standardized tests, we argue for a vision of formative assessment based on discipline-speciﬁc tasks and questions that can provide qualitative insights about student experience and thinking, including their identiﬁcation with disciplinary practices. At the same time, to be consistent with a productive formative assessment culture, grading policies should avoid using points and grades “to motivate” students but should create opportunities for students to use feedback to improve their work. We argue for districts as the locus for the design of such coherent curriculum, instruction, and assessment activity systems because districts have responsibility for curriculum, teacher professional development, and equity; and districts allocate resources for textbooks and assessment.},

Researchers have taken notice, and educational {MMOGs} are now beginning to emerge; however, there is a paucity of research on the actual culture/cognition of {MMOGameplay}, despite its necessity for sound theory and viable design. This paper outlines an ongoing cognitive ethnography of a currently thriving {MMOG}. Using discourse analytic methods, this project is developing a “thick description” (Geertz, 1973) of naturally-occurring gameplay, paying particular attention to the forms of socially and materially distributed cognition that emerge, the learning mechanisms embedded within community practice, and the ways in which participation shapes and is shaped by the situated (on- and off-screen) identities of its members. After outlining the data collection and analysis methods used, I present an illustrative analysis of selected data and preliminary findings specific to learning within this new virtual space for play.},

This study aims at examining (a) how teacher beliefs influenced practices; and (b) how the influence on practices, in turn, impacted student inquiry learning in a {CSCL} environment. Through a fine-grained comparative analysis of two cases, this study explores how two teachers with different collections of beliefs enacted the same mathematics lesson on division and fractions in a {CSCL} environment premised on inquiry principles, and what the connections between different enactments and students’ progressive inquiry process and outcomes were. The findings suggest that the two teachers’ adherence to different beliefs led to different practices, which in turn contributed to different student learning processes and outcomes. We interpret these differences that shaped the students’ opportunities for progressive inquiry in the {CSCL} environment. We conclude that the teacher holding “innovationoriented” beliefs tended to enact the lesson in patterns of inquiry-principle-based practices and technology-enhanced orchestration; these patterns interacted with each other to contribute to student inquiry learning and effective use of technology affordances.},

Without addressing the issues of effective learning, their use can compound the mistakes of the past and leave the learner with a passive, unengaging experience leading to surface learning. Educators need to recognise that learning is a social process and that providing an effective learning environment which facilitates the active acquisition of subject-specific and general expertise, and addresses the need to adopt a specific subject or professional culture, requires more than electronically delivered course notes and email discussion. Quality of course design, use of appropriate tools and the context in which learning takes place are prime factors affecting success in the era of mass higher education and lifelong learning.},

The chapter also considers the potential of drawing as an activity to increase student engagement with the epistemic practices in science to promote deep learning and interest. These two roles for drawing are illustrated by example activities of The Connected Chemistry Curriculum, a technology-infused curriculum that emphasizes drawing with molecular-level simulations.},

Such challenges have led to the development of an 'emancipatory' research paradigm.

	url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/logicism/},
	abstract = {Logicism is a philosophical, foundational, andfoundationalist doctrine that can be advanced with respect toany branch of mathematics. Traditionally, logicism has concerneditself especially with arithmetic and real analysis. It comes in astronger and a weaker version. , The strong version of logicism maintains that allmathematical truths in the chosen branch(es) form a speciesof logical truth. The weak version of logicism, by contrast, maintainsonly that all the theorems do. (By ‘theorems’ wemean results that are provable within the branch ofmathematics in question.) The foundationalism is with respect to thoseparts of mathematics that the logicist reconstructs. Success in thisregard is compatible, however, with a non-foundationalist (e.g.,coherentist) view of the parts of mathematics that cannot be soreconstructed. , Both versions of logicism—strong and weak—maintain that, For the foundationalist who accepts Kant’s distinction betweenanalytic and synthetic truth, the truths of logic are paradigm casesof analytic truths. They are true solely by virtue of the meaningsof the linguistic expressions involved in expressing them; or, {asKant} might have preferred it, by virtue of internal relations amongthe concepts involved. A successful logicist reduction of any branchof mathematics will therefore show that its truths (strong version) orits theorems (weak version) are analytic. , Another consequence of successful logicist reduction of a given branchof mathematics is that mathematical certainty (within that branch) isof a piece with certainty about logical truth. The same holds fornecessity; and for the a priori character of the knowledgeconcerned. , Logicist doctrines were espoused in two main forms—Fregean {andRussellian}—until around 1930, at which point logicism went intodecline, largely because of the discovery of Gödelianincompleteness, and the ascendancy of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory,which displaced the Russellian theory of types as the most promisingfoundational theory for mathematics. The doctrine ofneo-logicism subsequently revived some of the core ideas oflogicism, with its first hints appearing in the mid-1960s, and itsmore substantive contributions beginning in the 1980s. , The main technical and philosophical innovation of theneo-logicists is their use of abstraction principlesin order to secure the existence of such things as numbers,understood, with Frege, as logical objects. One favored kindof abstraction principle typically effects the reification ofequivalence classes of an equivalence relation.[1] One of Frege’s favorite examples involved the equivalencerelation of parallelism among lines. The relevant abstraction would bethat of the direction of a line. Thus, two linesl1 and l2 have the samedirection just in case they are parallel: , The function denoted by the abstraction operator d( ) ishere applied to lines, and produces directions (new abstractobjects) as its values. Note that the abstraction operator can takevariables as arguments. , The neo-logicists characterize abstraction operators that producenumbers as their values. Details of notation and method willbe provided in due course. , There has not been any historical trend discernible as anevolution of the doctrine of logicism, with incrementaladjustments to deal with occasional problems as they arose, whilemaintaining a reasonably stable trajectory towards an idealformulation. Rather, the doctrine has been characterized by abruptshifts as far as methods and materials are concerned, even if the goalhas remained relatively constant through such changes.[2] We shall allow the pattern of change to become evident as thedifferent phases of logicism are recounted below.},

We embarked on a series of design-based research projects to investigate a smart classroom infrastructure that scaffolds students and teachers in new forms of collaboration and inquiry, including a substantive role for large projected displays and small touch surfaces, as well as a dependency on students’ physical location within the room. This paper describes our designs, including: (1) the role of large displays for communicating aggregate and ambient information, (2) the role of real-time communication between students, (3) the application of intelligent software agents to enact real-time pedagogical logic, (4) support for learning across contexts, and (5) orchestration of inquiry roles, materials and environments. These designs are particularly relevant for the Learning Sciences community, as they offer insight into how the orchestrated classroom can support new forms of collaborative, cooperative and collective inquiry. One important outcome of this work is a set of design principles for supporting smart classroom research.},

Each argues that the long-term goal when dealing with rule breaking is to motivate rule breakers to become more self-regulating in their future conduct. This goal is undermined by punishment-focused models of sanctioning. Sanction-based models, which dominate current thinking about managing criminals, have negative consequences for the individual wrongdoer and for society. It is argued that greater focus needs to be placed on psychological approaches whose goal is to connect with and activate internal values within wrongdoers with the goal of encouraging self-regulatory law-related behavior in the future.},

Experiments with juvenile delinquency as an outcome demonstrate that positive results are more likely when interventions are aimed at more than one risk factor, last for a relatively long period of time, and are implemented before adolescence. Experiments featuring early childhood interventions with socially disruptive behavior, cognitive deficits, or parenting as an outcome generally have positive effects.

This idea has some intuitiveplausibility: consider the tyro toiling at multiplication tables orthe student using a standard algorithm for differentiating orintegrating a function. It also corresponds to some aspects of thepractice of advanced mathematicians in some periods—for example,the treatment of imaginary numbers for some time {afterBombelli}’s introduction of them, and perhaps the attitude ofsome contemporary mathematicians towards the higher flights of settheory. Finally, it is often the position to which philosophicallynaïve respondents will gesture towards, when pestered byquestions as to the nature of mathematics. Not surprisingly then, manyphilosophers of mathematics view “game formalism” ashopelessly implausible.

However, there are too few instructive models in teacher education that help connect teacher candidates’ knowledge of students and communities to development of efficacious physical habits, tendencies, and trends in observable behavior or teacher dispositions. The application of empathy operationalized through perspective taking is one such model useful to preparing teacher candidates to make professional decisions that produce evidence of {CRP}. Engaging teacher candidates in perspective taking—adopting the social perspectives of others as an act and process of knowing—invites them to obtain (and reason with) new knowledge of students and the sociocultural context where she or he will teach.

The purpose of the present research was to investigate how the effectiveness of invention activities may be mediated by composition of the small groups in terms of their mathematical skills. In two studies, small groups of undergraduates engaged in an ‘‘inventing standard deviation’’ task. Results suggested that groups may need at least one member with high math ability to take advantage of ‘‘learning by invention’’. Groups consisting of both high and low math ability members generated a broader range of solution attempts during the invention task, and this seemed to be related to better uptake of the standard deviation formula from a later lesson.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates whether prompting students to draw their own visual representations enhances students’ learning from technology-based instructional activities with visual representations. Seventytwo undergraduate students were randomly assigned to receive an educational technology with (1) drawing prompts throughout instruction, (2) drawing prompts before and after instruction, or (3) no drawing prompts. We assessed learning outcomes with respect to instructional effectiveness and efﬁciency using immediate and delayed posttests. Results on instructional efﬁciency showed a signiﬁcant advantage for drawing prompts. Results on instructional effectiveness showed an advantage at the delayed posttest for drawing prompts provided throughout instruction, compared to prompts before and after. Qualitative analyses suggest that adding drawing prompts throughout instruction promotes drawing quality. In sum, our ﬁndings expand theory by suggesting that drawing prompts facilitate visual sense making of concepts shown in visual representations. Furthermore, we provide practical recommendations on how best to implement drawing prompts with technology-based instructional activities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Likewise, it has recently been proposed that the same is true for interpreting literature, although there is little empirical research on how individual differences in epistemic cognition for literary reading impact literary interpretation (Lee, Goldman, Levine, \& Magliano, 2016). The development of a valid and reliable assessment of epistemic cognition for literature is an important step in examining this question. The present study takes a ﬁrst study toward such a scale in that it reports the development of a scale that for assessing adolescents' epistemic cognitions for literary reading, the Literature Epistemic Cognition Scale ({LECS}). Results address the content validity, factorial validity, criterion validity, and reliability of the three constructs assessed on the {LECS}: relevance of literature to understand people and the human experience; openness of literary works to multiple meanings and interpretations; functionality of multiple readings of literary works for interpretation. The study involved a large sample of middle school students in the U.S. Conﬁrmatory factor analysis validated the three-factor structure of the {LECS}. Criterion validity was established via correlational analyses between the subscale of the {LECS} and measures of the speed of acquiring knowledge, liking of reading, and frequency of reading as assessed through additional surveys. The implications of the results and directions for potential future research are discussed.},

Based on the experience of doing research commissioned by organisations of disabled people and other work carried out within a framework of `user's perspectives' on services and policy, the discussion focuses on the lessons we have learnt-and those we still need to learn-about how to change the relations of research production. Consultation between researchers and disabled people, subjecting research to critical scrutiny, and making researchers accountable to disabled people are suggested as key issues in the development of participatory research .},

The experimental study was conducted on 80 Form Two students, 40 of whom comprised the treatment group and 40 formed the control group. Data were analysed using the software {ANATES} 4 and {SPSS} 24.0. Significant differences were found in student achievements in relation to the topics of functions and limit functions according to their group type. Research outcomes also showed that teachers and students approved the use of {GeoGebra} in the teaching and learning of mathematics. {GeoGebra} can illustrate mathematical concepts and procedures well through visuals and graphs, which considerably aid students in mastering and understanding concepts and procedures pertaining to functions and limit functions. This software is user-friendly and can relieve the teachers’ burden in explaining functions. Even though the use of {GeoGebra} is time consuming, teaching by using the software can render the students’ learning process increasingly active. Moreover, learning mathematics with the help of {GeoGebra} allows for an active interaction between teachers and students. This study provides suggestions as interventions for increasing student achievement.},

An open-ended questionnaire, knowledge test, tasks, and participants’ dynamic constructions were used as data collection tools. The analysis of participants’ products was based on descriptive analysis and Toulmin’s model. As a result of the analysis, it was found that the participants constructed the relationship between the concepts of differential and derivative as well as the concepts of tangent and slope by using them within the geometric framework. Due to the integration of {GeoGebra} and the {ACODESA} method, the participants explored the relationships among true change, estimated change, and error by using the geometric interpretation of the concept of differential. It was found that with this method, they deduced that Δx and dx were two different symbols for the same variable.},

This paper looked into students’ motivation when using the V-Transformation courseware and an open source software, {GeoGebra}. The instrument used in this study was based on the {ARCS} model which consisted of attention, relevance, confidence and satisfaction components. Finding showed that there was a significant difference in the students’ attention using V-Transformation (M=4.05, {SD}= .811) compared to using {GeoGebra} (M=3.66, {SD}= .445; t(69)=2.514, p=0.014). Significant difference also was identified for the relevance component after using the V-Transformation (M=3.89, {SD}= .609) and {GeoGebra} (M=3.52, {SD}= .559; t(69)=2.641, p=0.001). However, no significant differences were found in students’ confidence and satisfaction using V-transformation and also {GeoGebra} software. For overall motivation, the finding showed that there was a significant difference between the motivation of students using Vtransformation (M=3.78; {SD} = 0.403) as compared to the {GeoGebra} (M= 3.50; {SD}= 0.458; t(69)= 2.704, p=0.009). This finding suggested that technology could be used to motivate students in teaching and learning mathematics.},

So far, however, there is a lack of review studies with focus on investigating factors such as: the uses, advantages, limitations, effectiveness, challenges and features of augmented reality in educational settings. Personalization for promoting an inclusive learning using {AR} is also a growing area of interest. This paper reports a systematic review of literature on augmented reality in educational settings considering the factors mentioned before. In total, 32 studies published between 2003 and 2013 in 6 indexed journals were analyzed. The main findings from this review provide the current state of the art on research in {AR} in education. Furthermore, the paper discusses trends and the vision towards the future and opportunities for further research in augmented reality for educational settings.},

To answer this question, we need to understand its configuration space, a 'map' where we can find every possible position of the robot. Unfortunately, these maps are very large, they live in high dimensions, and they are very difficult to visualize. Fortunately, for some discrete robots they are {CAT}(0) cubical complexes, a family of spaces with favorable properties. In this case, using ideas from combinatorics and geometric group theory, we can construct a 'remote control' to navigate these complicated maps, and move the robots optimally. Along the way, we face larger ethical questions that we cannot ignore.},

We present our process for developing equitable and instructionally supportive assessment tasks for multicultural students, resulting assessment tasks, and challenges associated with attending to
cultural relevance (Ladson-Billings, 1995; 2014) in assessment design. We ask the question: “How can we achieve equity and fairness in the design of assessment tasks that incorporate tenets of culturally relevant pedagogy ({CRP}) without introducing construct irrelevant variance?” We present an equity and fairness assessment design framework and explore the infusion of {CRP} in our assessment design process to determine the extent to which culturally relevant pedagogy can be applied. This work is in response to the adoption of the Next Generation Science Standards ({NGSS}), where teachers are faced with how to assess students from diverse backgrounds in science concepts, themes, and practices. Our design work is being carried out in the context of a multi-institutional collaborative, where we recognized a need for a clear and efficient approach to designing assessment tasks that can inform instruction in increasingly
diverse classrooms.},

In this period of time, the total number of academic publications containing Baugmented reality{\textasciicircum} in the Web of Science database, in all indices, was determined as 3540, and among these publications, 58 articles with {SSCI} index were analyzed within the scope of the research. It analyzes the change of articles related to {AR} by years; the usage of methods and data collection tools; education field, educational advantages, the type of applications used, technologies, assets used, physical environments in which researches were carried out, sensory types that applications address to, countries and continents in which the articles were published, and the keywords in these articles. Findings obtained were visualized with tables and graphics. According to the results obtained from the findings, there has been a sudden increase in the number of publications since 2013 and it reached the highest level in 2016, the most commonly used method is the mixed method and the data collection tool is questionnaire, most of the studies are carried out in Science, tablets and smartphones are most used, {AR} applications address to visual sense mostly and such articles are published mostly in the Asian continent. It has been determined that the most positive effect of {AR} on education is for academic success and learning motivation. It has been understood that the {AR} is closely related to disciplines such as human-computer interaction, robotics and remote laboratory systems. In addition, some suggestions have been made to researchers and developers based on these research findings.},

Visual interpretation of hand gestures can help in achieving the ease and naturalness desired for Human Computer Interaction ({HCI}). This has motivated many researchers in computer vision-based analysis and interpretation of hand gestures as a very active research area. We surveyed the literature on visual interpretation of hand gestures in the context of its role in {HCI} and various seminal works of researchers are emphasized.

	abstract = {In the past, ethics committees and researchers have avoided research among vulnerable groups because of prevailing perceptions that such research is unethical and difficult. Taking an opposite stand, this article will argue that it is in fact unethical not to research vulnerable populations because, by excluding potential participants from research endeavours, they are being deprived of the benefits to be gained from research. Albeit well meaning, people in vulnerable populations are also being subjected to the paternalistic attitudes of those who believe they know what is in the best interests of others. There is ample evidence in existing literature that, not only is research among vulnerable populations unlikely to result in harm, but there are often benefits to be gained by both participants and researchers. Apart from the generic benefits of increased knowledge and improved health interventions, specific benefits for participants might be: therapeutic, cathartic, educational, empowering, altruistic and social. In contrast, the risks associated with researching vulnerable populations appear to be minimal. Yet, there is still evidence that health care professionals and other gatekeepers continue to hinder research amongst vulnerable populations through unilateral decision-making. This article will review existing literature on the topic of research amongst vulnerable populations, as well as contribute to the argument from the author’s own study on a sensitive topic.},

	abstract = {In this paper we explore the use of {GeoGebra} (as a visual dynamic tool) and critical thinking skills for supporting high school students’ understanding of probability, more specifically, understanding of conditional probability and Bayes’ theorem. The research presented is part of a broader research project on improving high school students’ risk literacy and critical thinking. Decisions that involve the understanding of risk are made in all aspects of life including health (e.g. whether to continue with the course of medication), finances (paying for extra insurance) and politics (preemptive strikes versus political dialogue). These decisions are not only common, but they are also critical for individual and societal health and well being. Some studies have shown that people are routinely exposed to medical risk information and that their understanding of this information can have serious implications on their health. Despite its importance, most people are unable to adequately interpret and communicate risk. The goal of our research is to substantiate the claim that dynamic learning environment enables student to grasp abstract mathematical concept by manipulating mathematical objects constructed within these systems and implementing critical thinking skills.},

The study incorporated a pre-post approach that involved surveys to assess students‘ perceptions of psychosocial features of the learning environment, academic efficacy and students‘ enjoyment of mathematics lessons. A sample of 90 students from three colleges in the United Arab Emirates participated in the study. After the initial collection of quantitative data, Jeopardy!-type games were introduced to 90 students over a six-week period. The findings suggest that, during exposure to games, students experienced an improvement in the three psychosocial features of the learning environment (teacher support, involvement and personal relevance) and also academic efficacy and enjoyment of mathematics lessons. The results of this study offer potential opportunities for mathematics educators to incorporate the use of mathematical games in the curriculum as a practical way to improve classroom environments and students‘ attitudes.},

	abstract = {With rapid advances in social robotics, humanoids and autonomy, robot assistants appear to be within reach. However, robots are still unable to eﬀectively interact with humans in activities of daily living. One of the challenges is in the frequent use of multiple communication modalities when humans engage in collaborative activities. In this paper, we propose a Multimodal Interaction Manager, a framework for an assistive robot that maintains an active multimodal interaction with a human partner while performing physical collaborative tasks. The heart of our framework is a Hierarchical Bipartite {ActionTransition} Network ({HBATN}), which allows the robot to infer the state of the task and the dialogue given spoken utterances and observed pointing gestures from a human partner, and to plan its next actions. Finally, we implemented this framework on a robot to provide preliminary evidence that the robot can successfully participate in a task-oriented multimodal interaction.},
